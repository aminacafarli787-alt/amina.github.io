         <h3>Project 2 - Hour of AI</h3>
         <p>We taught students at school about algorithms and AI through the Hour of AI campaign (Computer Science Education Week 2025). Our team of four guided students in a fun and interactive session, helping them develop their understanding of AI concepts and share knowledge within their community.</p>
