      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> I'm Amina Jafarli. I'm passionate about innovation and creating effective digital experiences. Currently, I am pursuing my degree in Information Technology at ADA University, where I am developing strong foundations in programming, software engineering, and systems thinking. With a growing interest in back-end development, I continuously explore modern technologies, architectures, and problem-solving methodologies that shape today’s digital world. My commitment to learning has always extended beyond the classroom. I regularly take courses, read articles, and experiment with new tools and frameworks to stay ahead in a field that evolves every day. This ongoing education fuels my drive to improve, innovate, and create meaningful digital solutions. Although I’m a student, I’m continually building the mindset, technical skills, and problem-solving habits that define strong developers. With each project I take on, I strive to combine analytical thinking with creativity—transforming ideas into functional, user-centered digital experiences. As I move forward, my goal is to grow into a skilled back-end developer, contribute to impactful projects, and be part of shaping the future of technology.
