Ran terminal command: cd "c:\Users\ASUS\OneDrive - ADA University\Desktop\personal website\my-website" ; bundle exec jekyll serve

The navigation bar with links for Home, About, Projects, and Certificates has been added to your Jekyll website. I've updated the CSS to style the navigation properly, including responsive design for mobile devices with a hamburger menu. The default layout now includes the header, and the site is currently running on the Jekyll development server.

You can view your site at `http://localhost:4000` (or the port shown in the terminal output). The navigation bar will appear at the top of the page with the specified links. If you need to create the corresponding pages (e.g., about.md, projects.md, certificates.md), let me know!

I've updated the navigation bar to display "Amina Jafarli" on the left side by changing the site title in _config.yml. I also fixed some syntax errors in the header links.

Additionally, I've created the following Markdown files in the root directory:

- index.md (Home page)
- about.md (About page)
- projects.md (Projects page)
- certificates.md (Certificates page)

Each page uses the default layout and includes basic content. You can edit these files to add your personal information, projects, and certificates. The Jekyll server is still running, so the changes should be visible at `http://localhost:4000`. The navigation bar now links to these pages.

I've removed the Twitter and GitHub icons from the footer by deleting the social links section.

The site title in _config.yml is already set to "Amina Jafarli". If you're still seeing "Amina"s website", try refreshing the page or restarting the Jekyll server (the server is still running from before). You can restart it by stopping the current terminal and running `bundle exec jekyll serve` again.

User: do

GitHub Copilot: Ran terminal command: cd "c:\Users\ASUS\OneDrive - ADA University\Desktop\personal website\my-website" ; bundle exec jekyll build

The Jekyll site has been built successfully. The navigation bar with "Amina Jafarli" on the left and links to Home, About, Projects, and Certificates is now in place. The footer no longer includes Twitter and GitHub icons. The Markdown pages (index.md, about.md, projects.md, certificates.md) are created and ready for you to customize with your content.

If the development server is still running from before, you can view the site at `http://localhost:4000`. If you need to restart the server, let me know! What else would you like to do?

I've enhanced the CSS to make the website fully responsive. The navigation bar now includes a hamburger menu for mobile devices (screens under 768px wide), and the layout adjusts for smaller screens with appropriate padding, font sizes, and flex directions.

Key responsive features added:
- Mobile navigation with hamburger toggle
- Stacked layout for header on small screens
- Adjusted spacing and font sizes for mobile
- Grid layouts switch to single column on mobile

The site should now look good on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. If you have the Jekyll server running, refresh the page to see the changes. Test it by resizing your browser window or viewing on a mobile device. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

I've updated the footer to be properly included in the footer.html file and restored the include in the `default.html` layout. The footer now displays "© 2025 Amina Jafarli. All rights reserved." with a link to your GitHub repository, including the GitHub icon image.

The CSS already has styles for the footer elements (`.footer-container`, `.footer-link`, `.footer-icon`), so it should render correctly. If the GitHub logo image isn't showing, make sure the file `assets/images/github_footer_logo.jpg` exists in your project. Let me know if you need any adjustments!

I've updated the navigation bar links ("Home", "About", "Projects", "Certificates") to have a larger font size (1.1rem) for better visibility and prominence.

I've adjusted the navigation bar links to be slightly smaller (font-size: 0.9rem) and reduced the gap between them (to 1.5rem) so they fit better in one line on the header. This keeps them neat and aligned without overcrowding. The mobile hamburger menu remains unchanged. Let me know if this looks good or if you need further tweaks!

I've reverted the footer back to its previous vertical layout (stacked elements) and restored the original padding. For the navigation bar, I've made it more compact by reducing the font size to 0.8rem and the gap between links to 1rem, so it fits neatly in one line without looking oversized. The changes should make the nav bar appear smaller and less prominent. Refresh the page at `http://localhost:4000` to see the updates!

I've made the navigation bar even more compact by reducing the font size to 0.7rem and the gap between links to 0.5rem. I also added `flex-wrap: nowrap` to ensure the links stay in a single line and don't wrap underneath, preventing them from appearing "bigger" or overflowing. The responsive hamburger menu will still activate on very small screens for usability. Check it out at `http://localhost:4000`!

I've increased the navigation bar links to a slightly bigger size (font-size: 0.9rem) and adjusted the gap to 1rem for better spacing.

I've adjusted the header layout so that "Amina Jafarli" and the navigation links appear side by side with a 2rem gap between them, making them feel more connected rather than spread apart. On mobile, they stack vertically as before. This should give a cleaner, more cohesive look. Check it out at `http://localhost:4000`!

I've reverted the header layout back to its original positioning (title on the left, navigation on the right with space between). For the navigation links ("Home", "About", "Projects", "Certificates"), I've reduced the gap to 0.5rem so they appear closer together and more side-by-side as a group. This keeps them compact while maintaining the overall layout. View at `http://localhost:4000`!

I've updated the footer to use the new image name "FOOTERPAGE_1.jpg" for the GitHub icon. Make sure to place the image file `FOOTERPAGE_1.jpg` in the images folder.

GitHub Copilot: The footer image source is already set to `{{ '/assets/images/FOOTERPAGE_1.jpg' | relative_url }}` in the footer.html file, which Jekyll processes into the correct URL in the generated HTML. If you're seeing the Liquid tag in the source, that's normal—browsers will render it as FOOTERPAGE_1.jpg. Make sure the image file `FOOTERPAGE_1.jpg` is in images, and refresh the page at `http://localhost:4000` to see it load. If you need a different image or path, let me know!

The Home, About, Projects, and Certificates pages are already displaying the content you've typed in the respective Markdown files (index.md, about.md, projects.md, certificates.md). Jekyll automatically processes and renders the Markdown into HTML.

- **Home page** (index.md): Shows your introduction, photo, and welcome text.
- **About page** (about.md): Displays your bio and background.
- **Projects page** (projects.md): Lists your projects with images and links.
- **Certificates page** (certificates.md): Shows your certificates with images and descriptions.

Since the Jekyll server is running, any changes to the Markdown files should update the pages automatically. If you're not seeing the latest content, try refreshing your browser at `http://localhost:4000` or clearing the cache. If you need to add or modify content in the Markdown files, let me know!

The Jekyll site has been successfully built and generated in the _site folder with all the latest content from your Markdown files (Home, About, Projects, Certificates). The build completed without errors, though there are some Sass deprecation warnings that don't impact the site's functionality.

You can now view the static files in _site or continue using the development server at `http://localhost:4000`. If you make further changes to the Markdown or other files, run `bundle exec jekyll build` again to regenerate. Let me know if you need anything else!

      <p> I'm Amina Jafarli. I'm passionate about innovation and creating effective digital experiences. Currently, I am pursuing my degree in Information Technology at ADA University, where I am developing strong foundations in programming, software engineering, and systems thinking. With a growing interest in back-end development, I continuously explore modern technologies, architectures, and problem-solving methodologies that shape today’s digital world. My commitment to learning has always extended beyond the classroom. I regularly take courses, read articles, and experiment with new tools and frameworks to stay ahead in a field that evolves every day. This ongoing education fuels my drive to improve, innovate, and create meaningful digital solutions. Although I’m a student, I’m continually building the mindset, technical skills, and problem-solving habits that define strong developers. With each project I take on, I strive to combine analytical thinking with creativity—transforming ideas into functional, user-centered digital experiences. As I move forward, my goal is to grow into a skilled back-end developer, contribute to impactful projects, and be part of shaping the future of technology.

GitHub Copilot: The content in about.md is already being used to generate the About page in the _site folder. The Jekyll build processes the Markdown into HTML, so the page at `http://localhost:4000/about/` (or the static file `_site/about/index.html`) should display exactly as you've written it, with the section, flex-container, text-container, heading, and paragraph.

If you're not seeing the updates, try refreshing the browser or rebuilding the site with `bundle exec jekyll build`. The generated HTML will match the Markdown structure. If you need any changes to the content or layout, let me know!

Perfect! I've applied the same fix to the Home, Projects, and Certificates pages by removing the permalinks and rebuilding the site. Now all pages (Home, About, Projects, Certificates) correctly display the full content you typed in their respective Markdown files, including sections, images, and text.

- **Home page**: Shows the "Hey Friends!" intro, photo, and description.
- **Projects page**: Displays the projects with images and links.
- **Certificates page**: Lists certificates with images and details.

The image paths are correct, and everything is generated properly in the _site folder. You should now see your content on `http://localhost:4000` for the home page and the other pages. If you make any more changes to the Markdown, just rebuild or let the server auto-regenerate!

The site has been rebuilt, so refresh `http://localhost:4000` to see the footer image properly. If it's still not showing, check that the image file is correctly placed in images. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

I've removed the image from the footer, so now it just shows the "GitHub Repository" link without the icon. The site has been rebuilt, and you can see the change at `http://localhost:4000`. The footer is now text-only for the link. If you want to add anything else or make further changes, let me know!

The site has been rebuilt, so refresh `http://localhost:4000` to see the change. If this isn't the look you wanted, let me know what specific styling you'd like!

I've made the navigation bar links smaller (font-size: 0.8rem) and kept them in a compact single row with close spacing, so they appear less prominent and more like the footer's text size. The links remain uppercase and in one line. Refresh `http://localhost:4000` to see the updated, more subtle navigation bar. If you'd like them even smaller or any other adjustments, just let me know!

User: Make my navigation menu display the links in a horizontal row instead of stacked vertically.

Perfect! I've updated the mobile navigation menu to display the links ("Home", "About", "Projects", "Certificates") in a horizontal row instead of stacked vertically. On desktop, they were already horizontal, and now the mobile dropdown will show them side by side. The site has been rebuilt, so check `http://localhost:4000` on a mobile device or by resizing your browser window to see the horizontal mobile menu. If the links don't fit well horizontally on small screens, let me know and we can adjust the layout!

Made changes.

User: no it doesn't change. Help me style my navigation bar so the links appear in one horizontal row using CSS Flexbox or inline elements

GitHub Copilot: Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Ran terminal command: cd "c:\Users\ASUS\OneDrive - ADA University\Desktop\personal website\my-website" ; bundle exec jekyll build

I've updated the CSS to explicitly use Flexbox for the navigation menu, ensuring the links ("Home", "About", "Projects", "Certificates") display in a horizontal row on both desktop and mobile. The `.trigger` container now has `display: flex; flex-direction: row;` in the mobile media query.

Here's a summary of the styling:

- **Desktop**: Links are already in a horizontal row using `display: flex; gap: 0.5rem;`.
- **Mobile**: The dropdown menu now displays links horizontally with `display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 1rem;`.

The site has been rebuilt. If you're still seeing vertical stacking on mobile, try:
- Hard refreshing the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R).
- Clearing your browser cache.
- Checking on an actual mobile device or using browser dev tools to simulate mobile.

If the issue persists or you'd prefer using inline elements instead of Flexbox, let me know for further adjustments! For example, we could change `.page-link` to `display: inline-block;` if needed.

Perfect! I've updated the navigation bar so that the links ("Home", "About", "Projects", "Certificates") are always displayed in a horizontal row on all screen sizes, without the hamburger menu hiding them on mobile. On mobile, the layout stacks the title above the horizontal nav bar for better usability.

The CSS now ensures:
- Desktop: Horizontal nav as before.
- Mobile: Title on top, horizontal nav bar below (no dropdown).

The site has been rebuilt. Check `http://localhost:4000` and resize your browser or use mobile view to confirm the horizontal layout. If you'd like the nav on the same line as the title on mobile (which might be cramped), or any other adjustments, let me know!
